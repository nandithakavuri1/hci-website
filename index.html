      <h2>Why I find HCI fascinating:</h2>
      <p>
        Human-Computer Interaction is a dynamic and exciting field where
        technology meets human behavior. With a background in machine learning
        and natural language processing, I’ve always been intrigued by creating
        systems that understand and adapt to user needs. HCI allows me to blend
        technical expertise with an empathetic design approach, ensuring that
        systems are functional, user-friendly, and accessible. Through this
        course, I hope to explore how design principles and emerging
        technologies can improve the interaction between people and systems.

      <h2>My Skills and What I Bring to the Table</h2>
      <p>
        With experience in machine learning, and natural language processing, I
        bring a unique perspective to HCI. I’ve worked on building and training
        robust models, and deploying solutions that solve real-world problems.
        My analytical mindset, coupled with a knack for problem-solving, makes
        me a valuable contributor to collaborative projects. I’m passionate
        about learning and committed to creating systems that not only work but
        also delight users.
